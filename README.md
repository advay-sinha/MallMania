## Project Structure

# MallMania

MallMania is a small Python-based mall exploration game. Explore the mall, interact with NPCs, solve puzzles, and manage your inventory.

## Project structure

- `main.py` — Game entry point and main loop.
- `mall_map.py` — Map layout and navigation utilities.
- `npc.py` — NPC definitions and interactions.
- `puzzle.py` — Puzzle logic used in the game.
- `inventory.py` — Player inventory management.
- `assets/` — Static assets used by the game (images, items, etc.).

## Requirements

The project is written for Python 3.8+. There are no external dependencies listed in the repository. If this project uses Pygame or other libraries, add them to a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` and install before running.

## Quick start

1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Run the game:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

If `main.py` requires any command-line options, run `python3 main.py --help`.

## Development notes

- Follow the repository's existing code style when adding features.
- Add unit tests near new modules when appropriate.
- If you add external dependencies, add a `requirements.txt`.

## Contributing

Open issues or pull requests. Keep changes focused and include tests for new behavior.

## License

Add a `LICENSE` file to clarify the project's license. If no license is present, the repository's code is "All rights reserved" by default.

If you want, I can also:
- Add a `requirements.txt` and minimal `pyproject.toml`.
